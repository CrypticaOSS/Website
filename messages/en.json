  "faq-2-answer": "No. Due to the zero-knowledge design, we have no way to recover your data if you forget your master password. There are no backdoors or recovery mechanisms. This ensures maximum security but requires you to remember your master password.",
  "faq-3": "How does Cryptica protect against brute force attacks?",
  "faq-3-answer": "Cryptica uses strong key derivation functions (PBKDF2) with multiple iterations to slow down brute force attempts. Additionally, all encryption operations are performed client-side, which means an attacker would need direct access to your device to attempt brute forcing.",
  "faq-4": "Is it safe to use Cryptica on a public computer?",
  "faq-4-answer": "While Cryptica is designed to be secure, we generally recommend against using any security tool on public computers, as they may have keyloggers or other malware installed. If you must use a public computer, ensure you clear the browser data afterward and consider changing any passwords you accessed.",
